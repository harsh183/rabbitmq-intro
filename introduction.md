RabbitMQ Introduction

---

RabbitMQ is the most widely deployed open source message broker.

---

<!-- Better way of explaining it maybe -->

A message broker handles messaging between multiple protocols and recievers. 

Like postman delivering letters between different types of houses, everyone only has to know how to talk to the postman.
